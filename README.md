meg_playground
=========

A workspace to play with MEG data  

You'll need to create a subdirectory named 'MEG_data' and store the relevant data files there for this code to work.

Once your file structure looks good, you'll need to go to the 'notebooks' subdirectory and type  

    ipython notebook

There are a number of dependencies:

    ipython-notebook
    numpy
    scipy
    matplotlib
    pylab
    scikit-learn
    PyMVPA2 (from source [repos are out of date]: https://github.com/PyMVPA/PyMVPA)
