meg_playground
=========

A workspace to play with MEG data  

You'll need to create a subdirectory named 'MEG_data' and store the relevant data files there for this code to work.

Once your file structure looks good, you'll need to go to the 'notebooks' subdirectory and type  

    ipython notebook

There are a number of dependencies, but the main one you'll need is python-ipython-notebook in the Debian repositories
